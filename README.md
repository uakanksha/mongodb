# mongodb
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
MongoDB, the most popular NoSQL database, is an open-source document-oriented database. The term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. It means that MongoDB isn’t based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This format of storage is called BSON ( similar to JSON format).

SQL databases store data in tabular format. This data is stored in a predefined data model which is not very much flexible for today’s real-world highly growing applications. Modern applications are more networked, social and interactive than ever. Applications are storing more and more data and are accessing it at higher rates.
